            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>
                My name is Lucia, and I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual with a strong passion for
                learning and adapting to new environments. I hold an MRes in Biosciences (Distinction) from Aberystwyth
                University and a BSc in Marine and Freshwater Biology (Upper Second-Class Honours, 2:1). Throughout my
                academic journey, I have developed excellent time management and organizational skills, enabling me to
                multitask effectively and meet multiple deadlines with precision.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- More formal to get to know you better -->
            <p>
                My experience in scientific research has equipped me with the ability to collect, record, and analyze
                field and laboratory data efficiently. I have honed my skills in handling large datasets in an organized
                manner and presenting findings using Microsoft Office, DNASP, PopArt, Mega, and R for map creation.
                Additionally, I have gained experience in writing consultancy and scientific reports, demonstrating my
                keen attention to detail and ability to convey complex information clearly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Informal information about yourself -->
            <p>
                Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a variety of interests that reflect my love for
                creativity and exploration. Originally from Portugal, I relocated to the UK, where I continue to embrace
                new experiences. I am passionate about reading, as it allows me to expand my knowledge and unwind. I
                also enjoy baking, finding it both a relaxing hobby and a creative outlet for experimenting with
                different recipes. Spending time outdoors, whether hiking, exploring nature, or simply enjoying the
                fresh air, is another way I recharge and maintain a healthy balance in life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Final paragraph -->
            <p>
                With a strong commitment to continuous learning and excellence, I am eager to apply my skills and
                adaptability to new challenges and opportunities.
